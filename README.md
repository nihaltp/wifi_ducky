# WiFi Ducky üéØ 


## Basic Details
### Team Name: [Binary Fools]


### Team Members
- Team Lead: Nihal T P - Rajiv Gandhi Institute of Technology
- Member 2: Bharath Krishna G - Rajiv Gandhi Institute of Technology

### Project Description
This project is a Wi-Fi tracking tool using the ESP8266 that scans for nearby Wi-Fi networks and compares them against a list of target SSIDs and BSSIDs defined by the user. If a match is found, it activates a blinking LED indicator, and a local web interface (hosted at 192.168.4.1) allows users to manage the target list and view nearby network data in real time.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
What if you're too lazy to check who‚Äôs around... but still paranoid enough to want to know when they are near?

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
Just plug in this ESP8266, and let a glowing LED tell you when your neighbor‚Äôs Wi-Fi is close. Like a social radar‚Ä¶ but completely pointless.

## Technical Details
### Technologies/Components Used
For Software:
- C++ (Arduino core)
- ESP8266WiFi, ESP8266WebServer libraries
- FS, ESP8266WiFi, DNSServer,ESP8266WebServer 
- SPIFFS, Arduino IDE

For Hardware:
- NODEMCU ESP8266 
- USB to UART cable

### Implementation
For Software:
# Run

1.Flash the sketch to the ESP8266
2.Connect to the ESP Wi-Fi using password
3.Visit 192.168.4.1 in browser
4.Add target SSIDs/BSSIDs and blink away
